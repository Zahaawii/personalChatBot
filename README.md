# Personal Assistant LLM

This project focuses on building a lightweight Large Language Model (LLM)-based assistant that can partially respond using user-provided data — functioning similarly to a personal assistant. 
The goal is to allow users to supply documents or context, and have the assistant generate responses that are informed by that specific input.
